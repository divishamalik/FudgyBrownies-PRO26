Melt together the chocolate and butter.

Once melted add the brown sugar, coffee and eggs.

Add the dry ingredients.

Pour the mixture into a greased and floured pan lined with parchment paper.

Bake the brownies in a preheated oven at 180 °C (350 °F) for around 35 minutes. Do not over bake. See the toothpick test in the video to understand exactly when to take the brownies out of the oven, so they end up perfectly fudgy with a crackly top.

Cool for 30 minutes then cut into bars.
